[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

>> It seems that the random number generator is close to random as the PMF shows an almost uniform distribution of random values each with a probability of occurence equal to .001 or 1/1000.

The CDF shows an almost straight line indicating that the distribution of random numbers is almost uniform.
